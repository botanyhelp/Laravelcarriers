# Laravelcarriers project page

## This project used laravel 4.  

### There are too many complaints about stability, do keep things in mind:
1. Usually they are resolved by recreating everything
2. Laravel is supported
  *laravel.com
  *newrelic.com/laravel
3. Recreation does work and might be needed so keep notes. 
4. Lots of PHP modules are involved and so a stable and unchanging linux is nice. 
  1. www.php.net
  2. phptherightway.com
5. Filling a huge database will likely require several discrete filling events. 
6. Laravel has its own web server and its own mysql database server during development. 

### With its own web server and db server, no root access is needed.  
### Without root access, port > 1024 is needed, and usually port 8000 is employed
